\# Quantitative Methods Portfolio



This folder contains a few Python scripts developed \*\*as a self-taught learning project\*\*.

They are not production-ready, but rather work-in-progress exercises in quantitative finance and numerical methods.



\## Contents



\- \*\*SVI.py\*\*

  Implementation of SVI (\*Stochastic Volatility Inspired\*) interpolation.



\- \*\*SSVI.py\*\*

  Implementation of SSVI (\*Surface SVI\*) interpolation.



\- \*\*Heston\_utils.py\*\*

  Helper functions for the \*\*Heston stochastic volatility model\*\*.



\- \*\*GaussLaguerre\_utils.py\*\*

  Utilities for numerical integration using \*\*Gauss–Laguerre quadrature\*\*.



\- \*\*Extended doc\*\*

  PDF with the extended proofs and documentation.





\## Notes



\- All scripts are written as part of an ongoing self-study journey.

\- The main goal is to better understand pricing models and numerical techniques used in quantitative finance.

\- Code is evolving and may contain simplifications, mistakes, or naïve approaches.



\## Next Steps



\- Improve documentation and examples.

\- Add test cases and validation.

\- Extend functionality with additional models and methods.
